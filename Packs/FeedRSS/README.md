RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.
RSS feed keeps you up to date with every new article the site has published.

The Feed RSS pack contains the *RSS integration* that will create a Report indicator for each new article the configured rss has published. 
The *RSS Create Indicators From Report* playbook enables to extract and create indicators from the article content and create relationships between them.
